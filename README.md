# battleship

First time building a more complex javascript program.  Used javaScript and jQuery to create a playable battleship game.

Program generates ships which are placed on a board.  User can click on squares and if a ship is there, it will appear and user gets a hit.

Was challenging and exciting to apply the past week's JS knowledge.
